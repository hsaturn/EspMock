# EspMock
Mock for ESP8266 libraries

I may be 100% wrong, but I cannot find a way to make my unit test for TinyMqtt library.

So I decided to write a mock for missing headers. I'm pretty sure that that does already exists. But could not find where.
So this mock will do the job until I find a real solution
